    "The preliminary analysis and modeling report below uses United States and Canada's healthcare data on a hospital level in order to predict mortality-related features and readmission features. The United States datasets required more data clean-up and preprocessing than the Canadian dataset, however both datasets had high rates of missing values. Missing values were addressed using iterative imputation; categorical variables were addressed through encoding into dummy variables. For both datasets, both classification and regression models were attempted. Further exploration has to be done with feature selection, as there is unaddressed multi-colinearity and some features have very high variance inflation factors. In addition, ensemble classification methods and penalized regression methods may improve model performance once the multi-colinearity issue is resolved. "
